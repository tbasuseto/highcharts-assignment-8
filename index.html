  <h1>Social Media Use in 2018</h1>

<p>By Tabitha Basuseto</p>

  <p>The evolution of internet has created new avenues for people to communicate: social media. Pew Research Center conducted a survey on social media use of U.S. adults ages 18 and older between Jan. 3-10, 2018. The survey was done through a telephone interview that collected a national sample of 2,002 adults across all 50 states and the District of Columbia that were chosen through a combination of landline and cellphone random-digit-dial.</p>

  <p>Younger Americans ages 18 to 29 make up most of the population on all social platform included on the survey except for LinkedIn and Whatsapp, which are concentrated by adults ages 30 to 49, and Pinterest, in which the two age groups tied.</p>
